The [><>](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish) (or **fish**) side of this program can be run using [this online interpreter](https://suppen.no/fishlanguage/). 

[`Polyquine.fish`](/Polyquine.fish) isn't a shell script, it's a program in ><>. The reason the file extension is `.fish` is that angle brackets (`<>`) aren't allowed in filenames.
